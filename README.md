# AutoComplete

This is a basic functionality Autocompleter. Some code was taken from "code.activestate.com/recipes/578253-an-entry-with-autocompletion-for-the-tkinter-gui/" and has been modified. There are some bugs in searching for special characters. Please stay tuned for updated code as this functionality is resolved.

This code uses the two .csv files which are a collection of all stock tickers on the Nasdaq and NYSE to auto-complete a text box as the user is typing.
